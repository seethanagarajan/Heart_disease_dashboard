🔗 GitHub: github.com/seethanagarajan/Heart_disease_dashboard

I’m excited to share my Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard, developed using R and Shiny. This project focuses on identifying risk factors and patterns associated with heart disease using real-world medical data.

🔍 Dashboard Insights Include:
Key health indicators: Age, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, etc.
visual analysis of target vs features like chest pain, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina.
Interactive filters to explore insights across different demographics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
R Language
Shiny Dashboard
ggplot2 & plotly for data visualization
dplyr & tidyr for data manipulation

✅ A great project to demonstrate the power of R in health analytics, predictive analysis, and dashboard creation.
